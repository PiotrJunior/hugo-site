First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997[update], C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for making things like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows.
