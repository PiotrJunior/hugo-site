      <description>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[8] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.[9][10] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.[11] PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,[12][13] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[14]&#xA;Return to main page</description>

      <description>In computer programming, assembly language (alternatively assembler language[1] or symbolic machine code),[2][3][4] often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture&amp;rsquo;s machine code instructions.[5] Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but constants, comments, assembler directives,[6] symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros[7][1] are generally also supported.</description>

      <description>Scratch is a high-level block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an educational tool, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16.[8] Users on the site can create projects on the website using a block-like interface. Scratch was conceived and designed through collaborative National Science Foundation grants awarded to Mitchel Resnick and Yasmin Kafai.[9] Scratch is developed by the MIT Media Lab. It has been translated into 70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world.</description>

      <description>Swift is a high-level general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. Swift compiles to machine code, as it is an LLVM-based compiler. Swift was first released in June 2014,[11] and the Swift toolchain has shipped in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014.&#xA;Return to main page</description>

      <description>Kotlin (/ˈkɒtlɪn/)[2] is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin&amp;rsquo;s standard library depends on the Java Class Library,[3][failed verification] but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React)[4] or native code via LLVM (e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps).</description>

      <description>Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety—meaning that all references point to valid memory—without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its &amp;ldquo;borrow checker&amp;rdquo; tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust was influenced by ideas from functional programming, including immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popular for systems programming.</description>

      <description>COBOL (/ˈkoʊbɒl, -bɔːl/; an acronym for &amp;ldquo;common business-oriented language&amp;rdquo;) is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. Many large financial institutions were developing new systems in the language as late as 2006,[9] but most programming in COBOL today is purely to maintain existing applications.</description>

      <description>C (pronounced /ˈsiː/ – like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C&amp;rsquo;s features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[7] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</description>

      <description>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro &amp;ldquo;Matz&amp;rdquo; Matsumoto in Japan.&#xA;Return to main page</description>

      <description>C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced &amp;ldquo;C plus plus&amp;rdquo; and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997[update], C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for making things like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows.</description>

      <description>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.</description>

      <description>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024[update], 98.8% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users&amp;rsquo; devices.&#xA;Return to main page</description>

      <description>Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google[12] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[13] It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[7] and CSP-style concurrency.[14] It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.[15]&#xA;Return to main page</description>
